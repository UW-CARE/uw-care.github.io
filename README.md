# CARE - Clinician Augmented Reality Environment

Official project website for the CARE research paper: **Design and Technical Feasibility of Apple Vision Pro for Image-guided Surgeries**

Published in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 2025

## About

CARE explores using the Apple Vision Pro, a head-mounted AR device, to support image-guided surgical procedures, simplify the operating room, and improve situational awareness. The system achieves low latency video streaming (under 71 ms for 1080p) from surgical equipment to the Vision Pro headset.

## Key Features

- **Low-latency streaming**: <71ms for 1080p video over wireless LAN
- **Hand gesture controls**: Drag and resize virtual surgical monitors
- **Eye-gaze selection**: Select monitors hands-free using eye tracking
- **Improved ergonomics**: Customizable virtual monitor placement
- **Reduced sterilization needs**: Virtual monitors eliminate physical adjustments
